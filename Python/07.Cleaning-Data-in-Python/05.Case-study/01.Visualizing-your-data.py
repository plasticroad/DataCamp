Visualizing your data

Since 1800, life expectancy around the globe has been steadily going up. 
You would expect the Gapminder data to confirm this.

The DataFrame g1800s has been pre-loaded. Your job in this exercise is to create a 
scatter plot with life expectancy in '1800' on the x-axis and life expectancy 
in '1899' on the y-axis.

Here, the goal is to visually check the data for insights as well as errors. 
When looking at the plot, pay attention to whether the scatter plot takes the form 
of a diagonal line, and which points fall below or above the diagonal line. This 
will inform how life expectancy in 1899 changed (or did not change) compared 
to 1800 for different countries. If points fall on a diagonal line, it means that 
life expectancy remained the same!

Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Use the .plot() method on g1800s with kind='scatter' to create a scatter plot 
with '1800' on the x-axis and '1899' on the y-axis.
Display the plot.
