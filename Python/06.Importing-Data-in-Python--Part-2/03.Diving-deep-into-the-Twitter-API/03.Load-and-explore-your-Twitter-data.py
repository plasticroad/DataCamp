Load and explore your Twitter data

Now that you've got your Twitter data sitting locally in a text file, it's time to 
explore it! This is what you'll do in the next few interactive exercises. In this 
exercise, you'll read the Twitter data into a list: tweets_data.

Assign the filename 'tweets.txt' to the variable tweets_data_path.
Initialize tweets_data as an empty list to store the tweets in.
Within the for loop initiated by for line in tweets_file:, load each tweet into a 
variable, tweet, using json.loads(), then append tweet to tweets_data using the 
append() method.
Hit submit and check out the keys of the first tweet dictionary printed to the shell.
